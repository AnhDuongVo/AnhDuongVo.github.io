      text: |-
        At the ETH AI Center, I greatly enjoy collaborating across disciplines â€” from neuroscience and psychology to hardware, education, and computer vision â€” together with both academic and industry partners.

        My research interest is to 
        - develop new data science methods on multimodal data
        - build Machine Learning models inspired by the brain
        - contribute to human-computer-interfaces.
