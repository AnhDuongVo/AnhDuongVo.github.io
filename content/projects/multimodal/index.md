- Classifying behavior in images

Application in industry:
- Healthcare: Analyzing condition of motion and sensory processing of each patient
- Robotics: Develop robots with motion inspired by real humans
- Assistive Devices: tackling only motion dimension of a human and built assistive devices based on that
- Automated data labelling to train models for smart wearables
- Various Data analysis cases where limited time series data is a problem
