abstract: |
  This study proposes a mechanistic model of synaptic plasticity based on local competition for shared molecular resources. 
  Using computational simulations, we demonstrate how the availability and redistribution of synaptic building blocks 
  can shape memory stability, learning efficiency, and long-term connectivity balance.

summary: Reveals how competition for shared molecular resources shapes the rules and stability of synaptic plasticity.
